# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:

  # Revisions
  - trigger: ";rev"
    markdown: "Revisions due Dec 12 -- be sure to include [reflection form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igj2CqJ6pSrcEUVTo-yxQghGYUwxpBV9Bm9HiudAhMs/copy?usp=sharing) :)"
    #markdown: "Revisions due {{inaweek}} -- be sure to include [reflection form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igj2CqJ6pSrcEUVTo-yxQghGYUwxpBV9Bm9HiudAhMs/copy?usp=sharing) :)"

  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
